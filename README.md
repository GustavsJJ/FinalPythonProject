# FinalPythonProject
 "Getting things done with Python" final project

Please note that to launch webdriver you must have it installed on your computer (I was using Chrome webdriver).
This Instagram web scraper will not work properly for accounts or posts that have more than 1000 likes/followers/following (it can work but it will take a lot of time).

Program may not work because:
- username.txt or password.txt is empty,
- webdriver is not installed,
- program only works if the profile and post links are public,
- program has many time.sleep() functions which are approximate delays for webdriver to load. There might be a case where it takes longer for driver to load which can lead to error.


followerList.txt, followingList.txt and postLikes.txt are filled with information from my last update, so it is possible to see the data by launching Jupyter file if you do not want to execute "py.py".

Gustavs :)
